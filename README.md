# Huckberry Frontend Take Home Project

## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in Huckberry. As a Frontend applicant, we ask that you please complete this project.
You will need to use either Github or Bitbucket to submit your work.

Follow the instructions below for details on how to complete this project:

## Instructions: 

Please recreate our current Header Navigation UI (found at https://huckberry.com/)into a frontend application using React.js. 
**Note:** You are only expected to code out the non-scrolled version of the header, with the hover-dropdown functionlities, as seen in these gifs:

1) Fork this repository
2) Start a development sever with `npm start`
3) Implement the Header Navigation
4) Once complete, send the Github/Bitbucket link to bcohn@huckberry.com


### Your Header Navigation should:
* Display the data provided in `src/assets/NavigationData.json`
* Use logos and icons in the `src/assets` directory 
* Be pixel perfect (use web tools inspector for help on finding font sizes and colors).
* Function the same as it does on https://huckberry.com/ 
* Be able to receive more data (in the same format provided) and easily display it.

### Helpful hints:
* Remember the DRY principles when structuring your code.
* Please note the different layouts of the Clothing dropdown vs. the Journal dropdown.
