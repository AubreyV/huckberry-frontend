# Huckberry Frontend Take Home Project

## Introduction
The following exercise was put together for Front End candidates applying for a position at Huckberry. 
You will need to use either Github or Bitbucket to submit the finished project.

Follow the instructions below for details on how to complete this project:

## Instructions: 

You will be replicating our current Header UI into a frontend application using React.js.
create-react-app was already used, so you will be able to start a development server simply by using `npm start`

The header functionality you are to replicate can be found: https://huckberry.com/

**Note:** you are only expected to code out the non-scrolled version of the header, with the hover-dropdown functionlities, as seen in this gif: https://imgur.com/CkA4Tcj


### Project Goal
Please build out a pixel-perfect re-creation of our current Header Navigation and populate it with data provided in the `src/assets/NavigationData.json` file. 

You will also find the logos and icons needed in that folder as well.

* Style should be pixel perfect (use web tools inspector for help on finding Font Size and Colors).
* Should function the same as it does on https://huckberry.com/ 
* Remember the DRY principles when structuring your code.
* Your Header Navigation should be able to receive more data (in the same format provided) and easily display it.
* Please note the different layouts of the Clothing dropdown vs. the Journal dropdown.
